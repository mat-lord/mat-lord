# About Me ðŸ¤ 
Hey there! I'm Mat - a Senior DevOps Engineer at [Stax](https://stax.io).

Some things that I have been doing at Stax:

* migrating core services from EC2 to ECS, utilising ECS optimised AMIs and Fargate capacity providers
* refactoring and uplifting core business processes to improve speed and reliability
* abstracting common modules to reduce technical debt and follow a microservice architecture
* following strict development practices including unit testing, code review, technical documentation and observability
* design, build and implement customer-facing APIs in Python (Flask, OpenAPI, SQL Alchemy), using serverless AWS technology (APIGW, Lambda, Step Functions)
* automate and maintain the CI/CD pipeline using BuildKite and AWS CodeBuild
* implement and extend an IDAM (Identity and Access Management) solution using open-source software (KeyCloak)
* develop and distribute a public Python SDK (Software Development Kit) for interacting with our applications
* develop Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy and host the customer-facing applications
